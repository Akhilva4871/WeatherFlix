### Project Description
WeatherFlix is a web app that suggests movies based on real-time weather conditions using the OpenWeather API. It automatically detects the user's location to provide tailored recommendations and features dynamic backgrounds that change according to the weather.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The Problem: In an era of endless streaming options, finding the perfect movie can be overwhelming, especially when considering the current weather. Users often struggle to select films that match their mood and the environment, leading to a less enjoyable viewing experience. WeatherFlix addresses this by seamlessly integrating weather conditions with personalized movie recommendations.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The Solution: WeatherFlix provides a unique movie recommendation system that suggests films based on real-time weather conditions. By analyzing the current climate at the user's location, the platform curates tailored suggestions, enhancing the viewing experience and making it easier for users to find the perfect movie to match their mood.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Javascript
- React js, Express js
- axios, cors, express, bootstrap, react, react-bootstrap, react-dom
- @eslint/js, @types/react, @types/react-dom, @vitejs/plugin-react, eslint, eslint-plugin-react,vite

### Implementation
For Software: On the landing page, clicking the movie suggestion button utilizes browser geolocation to obtain the user's coordinates. These coordinates are sent to the backend, where the OpenWeatherMap API analyzes the current weather conditions. Based on this data, the application suggests movies from predefined arrays tailored to the specific weather.
